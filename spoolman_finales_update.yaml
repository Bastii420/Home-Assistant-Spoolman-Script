# Home Assistant Script: Spoolman Multi-Color Update for Bambu Lab Printers
#
# Author: Bastii420 (developed with the help of Google's Gemini)
# Version: 1.0 
# Date: June 18, 2025
#
# Description: 
# This script is called after a 3D print is finished. It iterates through all 
# four slots of the Bambu Lab AMS, reads the filament consumption per slot, and 
# adds it to the existing used weight in the Spoolman database.
# It is suitable for both single- and multi-color prints.
#
# IMPORTANT: The RFID/UID of the Bambu filament spools must be entered into the
# "Lot Number" (lot_nr) field in Spoolman for the matching to work.
